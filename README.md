Common files for ROS Tooling WG repositories.
Any files contained here will be used by repositories in this organization unless they explicit add one of their own.

This contains:
* Issue Templates
* A default CODEOWNERS file that can be used as a template for new repositories. Unfortunately this doesn't propagate automatically.
