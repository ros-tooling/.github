## ROS Tooling

This organization is dedicated to filling extra developer tooling & application utilities for ROS 2. The definition of "tooling" is very broad here, but its scope excludes the core functionality of ROS as a middleware framework.

The "Rosbag2 & Tooling Working Group" uses this org as a home base for work outside the core.

For a sense of the type of tooling maintained here:
- GitHub Actions for CI of ROS projects
- ROS 2 Graph Monitor for getting the overall state and health of your application, including complete topic statistics
- `topic_tools`, which provides a variety of useful nodes for manipulating existing topics in your application
- Rosbag2 B-Roll extension for dealing with encoded video streams
